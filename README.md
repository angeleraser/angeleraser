# Hello there! :wave:
My name is Angel I am 22 years old and I am a web developer, I currently live in Venezuela. <br>

I like to write code, for me it is like a hobby because I have a lot of fun although sometimes it gets a bit rough, I also like to solve code challenges in Hackerrank. <br>

I think that curiosity is the key to knowledge :bulb:.

2. CSS3.
3. Javascript ES6.
4. React JS (current learning).
